# Practice repo for Git/Github tutorial

This a repo to practice during the tutorial on Git/Github for [Software
Carpentry](http://sofware-carpentry.org) trainees.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn [basic Markdown syntax][daring-fireball].

    You can keep [this cheatsheet][markdown-cheatsheet] is handy or google for
other references. Note that there are different flavors of Markdown and no
standard, so some things won't work in all cases.
 
## Prerequisites

1. You know how to edit a file using *any* text editor.
2. You have `git` installed and an account in [Github].
3. You have some familiarity with `git`:
    * you know what commits and history are
    * you heard of `git commit`, `git add`, or `git diff` (it's **ok** if you're
      really sure about what they do).

> *Important*
>
> As with all Software Carpentry activities, you agree to follow [our code of
> conduct].
